If you don't know how Photoshop works, it's layered, say you design a button, that can *live* in a layer, you design a sidebar, that will *live* in another layer, this makes it possible to move things around.\n\nAlright, I designed the whole layout, header, sidebars, menus, contents, you name it. Once I was done I asked a friend for some feedback, he said *\"Looks neat, I would just place the menu a little more to the bottom.\"*, I did tried to move the menu a little to the bottom.\n\nGuess what, I built the **whole** layout in a single layer, the moment I started moving the menu **everything** moved along with it.\n\nü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n---\n\n# Pick up the pieces\n\nI ended up building the **whole** layout again, this time layer per layer.\n\nI don't think I need to tell you that **NEVER** happened to me again.

They _say_ after HTML + CSS\nyou **should** learn JavaScript basics before jumping into libraries.\n\nWhen I started learning how to code I had no idea what the hell I was doing,\nas most of us. I started learning HTML + CSS, the concept of a `div` being a box\nwas too much for me, it's perfectly normal thinking and questioning every single thing\nabout coding.\n\nNow per almost everyone I **had** to jump into JavaScript basics, well, I didn't. I went\nstraight from HTML + CSS into PHP, and you know what? It's fine. Back in the day, I was\nusing PHP for frontend development. I've been called a noob and that _\"I don't know how to code at all\"_\nbecause I used PHP for frontend, if you're one of those folks I can honestly say ‚Äî screw you.\n\nBack to JavaScript, again, before learning the basics I started learning jQuery straight away,\nthe basics came later, and once again it was fine.\n\n---\n\n# Your way is the right way\n\nI agree if you're working with a team you **should** follow best practices, but again, each\nteam has its own way of working, you'd need to adapt to their way from project to project.\n\nWhat happened to me by not _learning things the **right** way_ was that I'm curious,\neager to learn and most importantly I keep on building stuff, even after 13+ years.\n\nIf you want to learn PHP or Ruby on Rails just do it. It's OK to follow some advice here and there,\nbut sometimes it's just too much, it feels like _experienced_ folks are putting too much\npressure on you to follow the right way.\n\nSometime we're taking advice from folks that never built a single application in their\nlife, now tell me, if they've never built an application how the hell are they in a position\nof telling others how they should learn how to code?

That computer purpose was for mIRC, play video games and watch movies.\n\nMy first interaction with code was due to a group I had with my friends, one summer day we\nwere talking that it would be cool to have a website of the group, I immediately dived into\nfigure out how to build a website.\n\nI got as far as using a `\u003ch1\u003e` for a title and a `background-image` that for the life of me\nI couldn't figure out how to prevent it to repeat itself.\n\nYou guessed it, `background-repeat: no-repeat`. I quickly dropped that idea and just\nthought that this was definitely not for me.\n\n---\n\n# Before coding\n\nI dropped out of school in the 10th grade. I did half a year of arts, I developed a love for\ndesign since I was young. After that I did half a year in economics, attending school at night\nand living my teenage years during the day. What a waste of a year, geez.\n\nWhen I was 17 years old I started working in a bar, pouring drinks and making sandwiches, it was not bad, I was living with my parents, worry-free. I spent around 1 year working there.\n\nAt 18 I decided to get a more _serious_ job so I started working in a warehouse, picking products\ninto palettes for the major supermarkets in Portugal, I spent 2 years working there, and to be honest some\ndays I do miss it.\n\nWhile in the warehouse I started learning how to build layouts with Photoshop and slowly converting those\ninto HTML \u0026 CSS. We _(a friend and I)_ got a job for a client, building a website for ‚Ç¨4000, that's when it clicked, it was a lot of money, we could do this full-time.\n\n---\n\n# One startup\n\nAt 20 years old when I quit my warehouse job I decided to try my luck by creating a startup with my\nfriend. He quit his job as well, and we went for it.\n\nWe'd created our company in May 2008 and couldn't get a single client until September that year,\nwe kept scratching our heads trying to figure out what the hell we were doing wrong but once we got that\nfirst client, things started to flow naturally.\n\nBy the end of 2009, we had settled a big contract with a company in London, we were travelling back\nand forth, having the time of our lives.\n\nThings in Portugal were not going as we expected, the economy was crashing, taxes were going up and by the end of 2012 (when the London contract ended), we decided to close the startup and be done with it.\n\nI mean, it was good while it lasted, we learned a LOT from it, but it was time.\n\n---\n\n# First tech job\n\nIn September 2012 I moved to London looking for a better job, landed my first job after a month. I had\nplans to stay in London for at least 2 years and no longer than 5 years, I ended up staying there only\nfor 5 months.\n\nMy girlfriend was back in Portugal, I started missing her, my friends, family, everything to be\nhonest. I ended up making a deal with my employee, I could do a 3 month trial on remote work.\n\nI ended up working for them for 7 years while remote, with the occasional trip to London. In there\nI had the chance to learn quite a lot, that's where I learned Angular, TypeScript, ReactJS, RoR, etc;\n\n---\n\n# So far\n\nI'm now working for a great company full of talented people and an amazing culture. I live happily\nin Portugal with my girlfriend, our black labrador and expecting our first newborn.\n\nCheers to that! ü•Ç\n\n---\n\n# What else?\n\nWhat else can I say? Well, if you're looking for a job don't be afraid to apply, some people\ndon't apply just because they don't match 1 item on the requirements list, instead of not applying, see it this way: _\"Alright, I match 99% of the requirements this company is asking.\"_ ‚Äî go for it.\n\nWith my startup, I learned a few things as well, and the most important one was how\nto say **\"No!\"**, sometimes you just need to draw the line.\n","data":{"title":"How I ended up coding","date":"2020-07-02","og":{"description":"How I ended up coding for a living.

We can start by adding a new function that sets our theme either to `light` or to `dark` mode:\n\n```js:7\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\n\nimport \"./styles.css\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);\n  const toggleDarkMode = () =\u003e setDarkMode(darkMode ? false : true);\n\n  // ...\n```\n\nWe can still use a little trick on `darkMode ? false : true`, we can change it to `!darkMode`, what does this means?\n\nSince `darkMode` is a boolean we're _saying_ we want the opposite value, see the output:\n\n```js\nvar darkMode = true;\n\ndarkMode = !darkMode; // false\ndarkMode = !darkMode; // true\ndarkMode = !darkMode; // false\ndarkMode = !darkMode; // true\n```\n\nWe can do this all day!\n\n---\n\n## Button Switcher\n\nNow that we have our `toggleDarkMode` function in place let us create a `\u003cbutton\u003e` to use it:\n\n```jsx:4-6\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"App\" data-theme={darkMode ? \"dark\" : \"light\"}\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={toggleDarkMode}\u003e\n        Dark mode toggler\n      \u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003eHello stranger!\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003ch2\u003eLets persist our dark theme, shall we?\u003c/h2\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIf you try it out is should work just fine, switching from `light` to `dark` mode and vice-versa. We can still use our `darkMode` state to manipulate what the button displays:\n\n```jsx:!-2\n\u003cbutton onClick={toggleDarkMode}\u003e\n  {darkMode ? \"Lights ON!\" : \"Lights OFF!\"}\n\u003c/button\u003e\n```\n\nLet us move on.\n\n---\n\n## Persist\n\nThis is all good, but what if you switch to dark mode and refresh the page? We're back to light mode. Let us fix that shall we?\n\nFor that we'll be using React's `useEffect` and `localStorage`. First we need to import:\n\n```js:!-1\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n```\n\nWith `useEffect` we can run some code every time a value changes, in this case we want to run our code when `darkMode` changes:\n\n```js:9-11\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nimport \"./styles.css\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);\n  const toggleDarkMode = () =\u003e setDarkMode(darkMode ? false : true);\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    console.log(`Is in dark mode? ${darkMode}`);\n  }, [darkMode]);\n\n  // ...\n```\n\nIf you check the console you'll see what's happening every time we toggle dark mode. Now that we know this is working we can store our value in `localStorage`:\n\n```js:-2,3\nuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n  console.log(`Is in dark mode? ${darkMode}`);\n  localStorage.setItem(\"DARK_MODE\", darkMode);\n}, [darkMode]);\n```\n\nAlright, all good so far, now we just need read the value of `DARK_MODE` from `localStorage` and set our default `darkMode` value:\n\n```js:1,!-2\nconst storedDarkMode = localStorage.getItem(\"DARK_MODE\");\nconst [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(storedDarkMode);\n```\n\nGive it a try, change to dark mode and then refresh your page. Boom üí•\n\nThat's all, hope it helped you in some way.\n","data":{"title":"Persist Dark Mode with React","date":"2020-05-10","og":{"description":"How to persist dark mode with ReactJS","image":"https://telmo.im/og/persistdarkmodereact.png"},"author":{"twitter":"telmo","name":"Telmo Goncalves"}},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"persist-dark-mode-with-react"},{"document":{"content":"\nI've decided to open source this website.

Get your hands dirty with code, try to build something, I promise you, the second you start seeing stuff happening in a website, like styling a `div`, adding fancy typography, you'll fall in love.\n\n---\n\n## Use it\n\nWhen you're learning how to code you might think that you need to understand **everything**, well, I'm not saying you can't focus on understanding how things work. I like to use it first, then understand it, let me give you an example.\n\nA few years ago I was making an API call that returned an array with a few product lines, like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"name\": \"iPhone\",\n    \"price\": 999\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"name\": \"iMac\",\n    \"price\": 2999\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 3,\n    \"name\": \"iPad\",\n    \"price\": 699\n  }\n]\n```\n\nMy goal was to sum all the values, sort of like a shopping cart, I want to know what's the total.\n\nI don't actually have the code, but I remember I did something like this:\n\n```js\nlet total = 0;\n\narr.map(a =\u003e (total = total + a.price));\n\ntotal; // 4697\n```\n\n\nI thought that must be a better way of doing this crap, and like always, I googled it. _(Like everybody else does)_\n\nThat's when I found out about `reduce`, I'm not gonna lie to you, I've used `reduce` so many times and I **never** knew how it worked, absolutely no idea, until last year.\n\nOnce again I had to use `reduce`, but this time I though _\"I've used this so many times, let me just figure out what's happening behind the scenes.\"_, and I started digging.\n\nWith the same example, we can convert the previous code with:\n\n```js\narr.reduce((acc, a) =\u003e acc + a.price, 0);\n```\n\nI knew this worked, so I kept using it without even caring what was happening.\n\n---\n\n## Understand it\n\nLet us break it down, we'll start simple with a simple array of numbers:\n\n```js\nconst arr = [10, 15, 80, 30, 15];\n```\n\nDoing the math the sum of all those numbers is `150`. Using `reduce` it should return that same value. Take a look:\n\n```js\narr.reduce((acc, value) =\u003e acc + value, 0); // 150\n```\n\nAll good, now what's happening here? I like to call the first argument `acc` as in `accumulator` and second one `value` as in the value from the array entry.\n\nThis goes through each entry of the array, sort of like `map` or `forEach`. Since our array looks like `[10, 15, 80, 30, 15]` it'll need to run `5` times, one for each entry.\n\nWe can easily debug this with `console.log` and see what's happening with both `acc` and `value`:\n\n```js\narr.reduce((acc, value) =\u003e {\n  console.log({ acc, value });\n\n  return acc + value;\n}, 0);\n```\n\nThis will output the following:\n\n```js\n{ acc: 0, value: 10 }\n{ acc: 10, value: 15 }\n{ acc: 25, value: 80 }\n{ acc: 105, value: 30 }\n{ acc: 135, value: 15 }\n```\n\nTake the first run as an example, what's happening:\n\n- `acc` is `0`\n- `value` is `10`\n- It'll sum those values ‚Äî `0 + 10` = `10`\n- `10` is now stored in the `acc` variable for the next entry\n\nIt might sound a little confusing, if you're still not getting it drop me a message on Twitter, I'm happy to help üëá\n\n---\n\nI wanted to write this move focused on showing you something that I used for so many years without even knowing what it was actually happening behind the scenes.\n\nSometimes it's fine to just use it, if it works, why not? But if you have the time put an effort and trying to understand how things work, not all of them, you might\nnot need it üôÇ\n\n","data":{"title":"Use it, then understand it.","date":"2020-04-29","og":{"description":"I've used reduce for too many years without knowing how it worked.","image":"https://telmo.im/og/understandit.png"},"author":{"twitter":"telmo","name":"Telmo Goncalves"}},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"use-it-then-understand-it"},{"document":{"content":"\nI've been noticing that one of the biggest issues with new developers is that they think they need to know **EVERYTHING**.\n\nDon't fool yourself, there's not one single developer in the world that knows everything, all those high tech people you look up to, they **don't** know everything, that's a fact.

Check the comments on the code:\n\n```js\nconst array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\n\n// Get only odd numbers\narray.filter(value =\u003e value \u0026 1); // [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n\n// Get only even numbers\narray.filter(value =\u003e !(value \u0026 1)); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n\n// Get values between `3` and `8`\narray.filter(value =\u003e value \u003e 3 \u0026\u0026 value \u003c 8); // [4, 5, 6, 7]\n```\n\nAs you can see we can use `filter()` in many ways, lets play\na little bit with `strings` üôÇ\n\n---\n\n## Strings\n\nAgain, lets set up a simple array:\n\n```js\nconst array = [\"@telmo\", \"https://telmo.im\", \"Fullstack Developer\"]\n```\n\nLets assume we want to filter just URLs, so, we\ncan filter strings that start with `http` as an example:\n\n```js:3\nconst array = [\"@telmo\", \"https://telmo.im\", \"Fullstack Developer\"];\n\narray.filter(value =\u003e value.startsWith(\"http\"));\n```\n\nThis will return `[\"https://telmo.im\"]`. I love JavaScript!\n\nSince we know handlers start with an `@`, we can do exactly the same\nthing to filter all handlers, lets add a few more entries into our array:\n\n```js\nconst array = [\n  \"Telmo\", \"@telmo\", \"@codinghubio\", \"Coding Hub\"\n]\n\narray.filter(value =\u003e value.startsWith(\"@\"));\n```\n\nThis should return `[\"@telmo\", \"@codinghubio\"]`, sweet!\n\n---\n\n## Objects\n\nFinally, lets just go through a more complex array, an array\nof objects, lets assume an array of profiles:\n\n```js\nconst profiles = [\n  { name: \"Telmo\", handler: \"@telmo\", followers: 1000 },\n  { name: \"Catalin\", handler: \"@catalinmpit\", followers: 2000 },\n  { name: \"Marc\", handler: \"@_marcba\", followers: 3000 },\n];\n```\n\nNow lets try and filter profiles that have more than `1000` followers:\n\n```js\nprofiles.filter(value =\u003e value.followers \u003e 1000);\n```\n\nWith this filter you should get:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Catalin\",\n    \"handler\": \"@catalinmpit\",\n    \"followers\": 2000\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Marc\",\n    \"handler\": \"@_marcba\",\n    \"followers\": 3000\n  }\n]\n```\n\nIn the filter you can do another thing, which is destructuring the\n`followers` directly, like this:\n\n```js\nprofiles.filter(({ followers }) =\u003e followers \u003e 1000);\n```\n\n---\n\nI was about to end this writing now, but... We can still use another\napproach into how we filter arrays.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nLets assume we have an array with `numbers` and `strings`, and we\nwant to filter the array to return just the `strings`, how do we\ncheck in JavaScript if something is a `string`?\n\n```js\ntypeof something === \"string\"\n```\n\nRight, lets take the following example:\n\n```js\nconst array = [1, 3, \"Telmo\", 4, 6, \"@telmo\"];\n\n// We can use the `typeof` directly in the filter\narray.filter(value =\u003e typeof value === \"string\");\n```\n\nIt should return `[\"Telmo\", \"@telmo\"]`, awesome! But, we can\nrefactor this a little bit, assume you might want to use a function\nthat checks if *something* is a `string`, lets take a look:\n\n```js\nconst array = [1, 3, \"Telmo\", 4, 6, \"@telmo\"];\n\nfunction isString(value) {\n  return typeof value === \"string\";\n}\n\narray.filter(isString);\n```\n\nThis returns exactly the same `[\"Telmo\", \"@telmo\"]`, but look how\nour `filter()` got much cleaner, and bonus, you can re-use the `isString()`\nfunction somewhere else.\n\n\u003e Note that this is not a **right way** of doing things approach, you should use whatever you think is fits you best.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThat's it, hope it helped somehow ‚úåÔ∏è\n","data":{"title":"Filtering arrays in JavaScript","date":"2020-04-23","og":{"description":"Learn how to use the filter with arrays in JavaScript","image":"https://telmo.im/og/arrayfilter.png"},"author":{"twitter":"telmo","name":"Telmo Goncalves"}},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"filtering-js-arrays"},{"document":{"content":"\nI've implemented dark/light mode before using `styled-components`\nas well as `SCSS`, but this time I wanted to do it just using `CSS`,\nso gave it a go, and it's so simple.\n\n## The CSS\n\nFirst of all lets create a `style.css` file, it can be in the root\nof our project, we'll keep this simple and straight to the point.\n\nOpen your command line, navigate to whatever folder you keep your projects\nand run the following:\n\n```bash\ntake dark-light-mode \u0026\u0026 touch style.css\n```\n\n\u003e If you're wondering what `take` does, it'll create a new directory for you and auto navigate to it.\n\nNow, in our `style.css` file lets put the following code, this will be the variables for the default (light) theme:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --bg-color: #fff;\n  --text-color: #000;\n}\n```\n\nIn order to see this working, we need to create a `HTML` file, so lets do\nthat, in your command line run:\n\n```bash\ntouch index.html\n```\n\nAnd put the following code, you can notice we're already importing our\n`style.css` file:\n\n```html:5\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003chead\u003e\n  \u003ctitle\u003eLight and Dark Mode\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\"\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n  \u003ch1\u003eOur own dark / light app!\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nIf you go ahead and open `index.html` in your browser you should see\na title **\"Our own dark / light app!\"**.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nNow let us start adding some styling.

Go\nto the `components/Layout.js` file and let's make some changes:\n\n```js:!-1,-7-8,11-12\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'\n\nimport { GlobalStyles } from '../styles/global'\nimport { lightTheme, darkTheme } from '../styles/themes'\n\n// Default dark mode to true for now\nconst darkMode = true\n\nfunction Layout({ children }) {\n  // Use the state to determine darkMode\n  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(true)\n\n  return (\n    // This will pass `theme` from `ThemeProvider` as a prop into `GlobalStyles`\n    \u003cThemeProvider theme={darkMode ? darkTheme : lightTheme}\u003e\n      \u003cGlobalStyles /\u003e\n      {children}\n    \u003c/ThemeProvider\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Layout\n```\n\nIf you refresh the page, you should see the same behaviour: dark background, white text.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nLet's make a quick change to check if our **Light** theme is working as well, change\nour `darkMode` state from `true` to `false`:\n\n```js:!-3\nfunction Layout({ children }) {\n  // Use the state to determine darkMode\n  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false)\n\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nRefresh the page; you should see the original theme: white background, dark text üëå\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n#### The Switch\n\nWe'll be using the `setDarkMode` method from the previous code, we'll create a\n`\u003cbutton\u003e` with an `onClick` prop:\n\n```js:14-18\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'\n\nimport { GlobalStyles } from '../styles/global'\nimport { lightTheme, darkTheme } from '../styles/themes'\n\nfunction Layout({ children }) {\n  // Use the state to determine darkMode\n  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(true)\n\n  return (\n    // This will pass `theme` from `ThemeProvider` as a prop into `GlobalStyles`\n    \u003cThemeProvider theme={darkMode ? darkTheme : lightTheme}\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setDarkMode(!darkMode)}\u003e\n          {darkMode ? 'Light it up!' : 'Turn the light off!'}\n        \u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cGlobalStyles /\u003e\n      {children}\n    \u003c/ThemeProvider\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Layout\n```\n\nSo, what are we doing with `onClick={() =\u003e setDarkMode(!darkMode)}`, we're setting\nthe `darkMode` state by using the `! (not)` operator, which inverts the boolean expression:\n\n```js\nlet darkMode = true\n\ndarkMode = !darkMode // false\ndarkMode = !darkMode // true\n```\n\n---\n\n## Persistence\n\nYou should notice that every time you refresh your application and theme falls back to the light theme,\nwell, let's deal with that.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nFor that we'll take advantage of `localStorage` and React Hooks `useEffect` method. Let's take a look:\n\n```js:!-1,11-13\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'\n\nimport { GlobalStyles } from '../styles/global'\nimport { lightTheme, darkTheme } from '../styles/themes'\n\nfunction Layout({ children }) {\n  // Use the state to determine darkMode\n  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(true)\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    console.log(`Using dark mode? ${darkMode}`)\n  }, [darkMode]) // Run every time `darkMode` changes\n\n  return (\n    // This will pass `theme` from `ThemeProvider` as a prop into `GlobalStyles`\n    \u003cThemeProvider theme={darkMode ? darkTheme : lightTheme}\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setDarkMode(!darkMode)}\u003e\n          {darkMode ? 'Light it up!' : 'Turn the light off!'}\n        \u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cGlobalStyles /\u003e\n      {children}\n    \u003c/ThemeProvider\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Layout\n```\n\nOpen your developer console, every time you switch between light and dark mode, you should\nsee logs such as:\n\n```text\nUsing dark mode? false\nUsing dark mode? true\nUsing dark mode? false\n```\n\nGreat, that means `useEffect` is working as expected. Although, is you refresh the page\nit keeps falling back to the light theme.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nLet's use `localStorage` to fix that:\n\n```js:-12,13\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'\n\nimport { GlobalStyles } from '../styles/global'\nimport { lightTheme, darkTheme } from '../styles/themes'\n\nfunction Layout({ children }) {\n  // Use the state to determine darkMode\n  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(true)\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    console.log(`Using dark mode? ${darkMode}`)\n    localStorage.setItem('DARK_MODE', darkMode)\n  }, [darkMode]) // Run every time `darkMode` changes\n\n  return (\n    // This will pass `theme` from `ThemeProvider` as a prop into `GlobalStyles`\n    \u003cThemeProvider theme={darkMode ? darkTheme : lightTheme}\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setDarkMode(!darkMode)}\u003e\n          {darkMode ? 'Light it up!' : 'Turn the light off!'}\n        \u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cGlobalStyles /\u003e\n      {children}\n    \u003c/ThemeProvider\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Layout\n```\n\nYou can check if this is working as expected in the developer tools console,\nunder **Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí http://localhost:3000**, you should see:\n\n| Key        | Value |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| `DARK_MODE`      | `true` or `false` |\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nOnce again, on refresh it's still falling back to the light theme, to fix that we\nneed to make a small change, we need to get the value from `localStorage` and\nset as our default `darkMode` state:\n\n```js:!-9,11-15\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'\n\nimport { GlobalStyles } from '../styles/global'\nimport { lightTheme, darkTheme } from '../styles/themes'\n\nfunction Layout({ children }) {\n  // Use the state to determine darkMode\n  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState()\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    const darkModeValue = localStorage.getItem('DARK_MODE')\n    // localStorage returns a string, not a boolean\n    setDarkMode(darkModeValue === 'true')\n  }, [])\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    localStorage.setItem('DARK_MODE', darkMode)\n  }, [darkMode]) // Run every time `darkMode` changes\n\n  return (\n    // This will pass `theme` from `ThemeProvider` as a prop into `GlobalStyles`\n    \u003cThemeProvider theme={darkMode ? darkTheme : lightTheme}\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n         \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setDarkMode(!darkMode)}\u003e\n          {darkMode ? 'Light it up!' : 'Turn the light off!'}\n        \u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n\n      \u003cGlobalStyles /\u003e\n      {children}\n    \u003c/ThemeProvider\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Layout\n```\n\nWe could have got the `localStorage` value before setting the state, but `localStorage`\nis still not available because it's not part of NextJS, so this is a nice work-around.\n\n---\n\n## What the flash?\n\nYou might have noticed that when reloading your application while in dark mode,\nthe page kind of _flashes_ between light and dark mode. Well, we also can use `useEffect`\nas a good work-around to prevent that, let's set another state ‚Äì `mounted`:\n\n```js:6,12-13\n// ...\n\nfunction Layout({ children }) {\n  // Use the state to determine darkMode\n  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState()\n  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    const darkModeValue = localStorage.getItem('DARK_MODE')\n    // localStorage returns a string, not a boolean\n    setDarkMode(darkModeValue === 'true')\n    // Set mounted to `true` only after setting the `darkMode` state\n    setMounted(true)\n  }, [])\n\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nAlright, now we can simply render an empty `\u003cdiv /\u003e` before the component has been mounted,\nthis will prevent the component to render our styles, `ThemeProvider` etc before we set the\n`darkMode` state:\n\n```js:24\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'\n\nimport { GlobalStyles } from '../styles/global'\nimport { lightTheme, darkTheme } from '../styles/themes'\n\nfunction Layout({ children }) {\n  // Use the state to determine darkMode\n  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState()\n  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    const darkModeValue = localStorage.getItem('DARK_MODE')\n    // localStorage returns a string, not a boolean\n    setDarkMode(darkModeValue === 'true')\n    // Set mounted to `true` only after setting the `darkMode` state\n    setMounted(true)\n  }, [])\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    localStorage.setItem('DARK_MODE', darkMode)\n  }, [darkMode]) // Run every time `darkMode` changes\n\n  if (!mounted) return \u003cdiv /\u003e\n\n  return (\n    // This will pass `theme` from `ThemeProvider` as a prop into `GlobalStyles`\n    \u003cThemeProvider theme={darkMode ? darkTheme : lightTheme}\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n         \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setDarkMode(!darkMode)}\u003e\n          {darkMode ? 'Light it up!' : 'Turn the light off!'}\n        \u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n\n      \u003cGlobalStyles /\u003e\n      {children}\n    \u003c/ThemeProvider\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Layout\n```\n\nIf you reload your application, the _flash_ between light and dark mode should be gone.\n\n---\n\n## Source Code\n\nYou can find the source code of this tutorial [here](https://github.com/telmogoncalves/nextjs-markdown-blog),\ndon't forget it's under the branch `dark-mode`.\n","data":{"title":"Enabled dark mode with styled-components","date":"2020-01-08","author":{"twitter":"telmo","name":"Telmo Goncalves"}},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"dark-mode-enabled"},{"document":{"content":"\nDestructuring is a convenient way of extracting multiple values\nfrom data stored in objects and Arrays.\n\n---\n\nLet's take a look on how to destructure an object:\n\n```js\nconst info = { name: 'Telmo', age: 33, twitterHandler: '@telmo' }\n\n// Destructure data from `info`\nconst { name, age, twitterHandler } = info\n\nconsole.log(name, age, twitterHandler) // Telmo 33 @telmo\n```\n\nWhat we've done here? Instead of accessing the data through `info.name`, `info.age`, etc;\nWe extracted the data from `info`, this way you prevent calling `info.X` multiple times.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nLet's mock an example where you're making an API call, for this we'll be using\n[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), you can take a look to figure\nout what it does.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nA straight forward example is the one provided in the homepage, where we can fetch data\nfrom [here](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1) and it should return something like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"title\": \"delectus aut autem\",\n  \"completed\": false\n}\n```\n\nLet's build a simple component so we can then extract the data from the API call:\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react'\n\nexport default function MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003eMy amazing component üöÄ\u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nGreat, now let's assume the data from the API call is being passed to the component\nthrough `props`, we can either extract the data before we `return` our component:\n\n```js:!-3,4,7-12\nimport React from 'react'\n\nexport default function MyComponent(props) {\n  const { userId, id, title, completed } = props\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      Task ID: {id}\n      Created by user ID: {userId}\n      Task title: {title}\n      Completed: {completed}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLooks great, but we can still save at least one least in your code, take a look:\n\n```js:!-3,-4\nimport React from 'react'\n\nexport default function MyComponent({ userId, id, title, completed }) {\n  const { userId, id, title, completed } = props\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      Task ID: {id}\n      Created by user ID: {userId}\n      Task title: {title}\n      Completed: {completed}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nBy extracting the data directly on `MyComponent()`, we no longer need\nto extract the data through `const { ... } = props`.\n\n---\n\n## Let's play without brackets (Arrays)\n\nCheck the example bellow and notice the comments:\n\n```js\nconst myTags = ['React', 'Next', 'Gatsby']\n\n// Get first element of the array\nconsole.log(myTags[0]) // React\n\n// Destructuring the array\nconst [tag] = myTags\n\nconsole.log(tag) // React\n```\n\nLooks way better.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nGoing a little further, I found out about this just a few days ago, and it's\namazing how good the code looks using this. Let's imagine the following data structure:\n\n```json\n\"deliveries\": [\n  {\n    \"id\": 337948,\n    \"shipments\": [\n      {\n        \"number\": \"FOO-5905959044\",\n        \"products\": [\n          {\n            \"title\": \"Apple Pie\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"title\": \"6 Pack Coronas\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"title\": \"Doritos\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"title\": \"Burgers\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\nLet's destructure this sucker using the same component as before,\nassuming this data is being passed to the component `props`:\n\n```js\n // Destructuring happening right here within `MyComponent()`\nexport default function MyComponent({\n  data: { deliveries }\n}) {\n  return (\n    deliveries.map(delivery =\u003e {\n      const {\n        id,\n         // Beauty of destructuring arrays\n        shipments: [shipment]\n      } = delivery\n      // Destructuring data from the first array of `shipments`\n      const { number, products } = shipment\n\n      return (\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n          Order with ID {id} and tracking shipment\n          number {number}\n\n          \u003cul\u003e\n            {products.map(({ title }) =\u003e ( // Destructuring happening here within `()`\n              \u003cli\u003e{title}\u003c/li\u003e\n            ))}\n          \u003c/ul\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n      )\n    })\n  )\n}\n```\n\nYou can check [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/infallible-wilbur-xo90i) I've put together.\n","data":{"title":"Destructure Everything","date":"2020-01-08","author":{"twitter":"telmo","name":"Telmo Goncalves"}},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"destructure-everything"}]}},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"gIAteaE-yUMFqKKForXV3","nextExport":true,"isFallback":false,"gip":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-d2c1c4c47aa8df0ca323.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-52a1290235e720a5a2e8.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.7edd608ea8f84e4e934e.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.2a4097ca1b0094b9ce26.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-290b7b482766089a625a.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/styles.3ab6a20409bb33dae893.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-1519d2ff9279a1afc77a.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/9f96d65d.3f3e4ee454904b796427.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/69ad993357b91a7f848e97cfb01dbaba86f3f9e5.6b776a7b88f2e0e58e33.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/494502f7545bb57908141b4dff6fab57757f6ce0.83895583a0c7124422c0.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/494502f7545bb57908141b4dff6fab57757f6ce0_CSS.210d3c80a2b0e2401248.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/da1033d6aa30b34964a28d1ec55be39afe569b74.7050f7580e7ef368d4ac.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/index-b9c208d6efa1b58a2d32.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/gIAteaE-yUMFqKKForXV3/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/gIAteaE-yUMFqKKForXV3/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
