Most people are afraid to fail and that's a big problem, failure is the stepping stone to success. By failing you end up **always** learning something. In tech this is a major thing to embrace, we fail on a daily basis, but guess what, that's totally fine.

# Oops

Let me tell you a story, I started my career as a designer, I already had played around with Photoshop and Illustrator, back in 2007 if you wanted a button with border you had to use images, `border-radius` wasn't a thing, I know right?

So, I had this website to build, it was my first time designing a layout in Photoshop. If you don't know how Photoshop works, it's layered, say you design a button, that can *live* in a layer, you design a sidebar, that will *live* in another layer, this makes it possible to move things around.

Alright, I designed the whole layout, header, sidebars, menus, contents, you name it. Once I was done I asked a friend for some feedback, he said *"Looks neat, I would just place the menu a little more to the bottom."*, I did tried to move the menu a little to the bottom.

Guess what, I built the **whole** layout in a single layer, the moment I started moving the menu **everything** moved along with it.

# Pick up the pieces

I ended up building the **whole** layout again, this time layer per layer.

I don't think I need to tell you that **NEVER** happened to me again. As you can see just because you fail once, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre gonna fail at everything.

It's also good to share your failures, makes you stronger, believe you me, and again, don't be afraid to fail. **Go for it.**
